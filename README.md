# Survey_data_analysis
## Tool used:
Python (Jupyter Notebook)

## Library:

<ul>
<li>pandas</li>
<li>plotly.graph_objects (to plot)</li>
<li>plotly.io (to export static plot image)</li>
</ul>

<br> As github repositories don’t support interactive plots so that I use plotly.io to make the plots static (this require to install orca or kaleido) . This step is only for github requirement. I don’t recommend using static plots. It’s better to make plots interactive.<br>

<br>
<h3>N.B:</h3>
This dummy dataset is from "codebasics.io". it’s completely free. You can download it if you want and practice analysis.
<br>
I would love to see your discoveries.
